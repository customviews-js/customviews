# Reader Guide

Welcome! This documentation site is built with **CustomViews**, designed to give you, the reader, control over how you view the content.

This plugin allows websites to give you the ability to customize your reading experience to match your preferences—whether you are looking for a quick overview or a deep dive into technical details.

## Customizing Your View

You can personalize your experience using the **Settings Panel**.

### The Settings Panel

Look for the floating **Settings Icon** <i class="fas fa-gear"></i> (usually located at the middle-left or right of your screen). Clicking this icon opens the customization settings panel.

> **First time here?** You might see a pulsing helpful "callout" pointing to the settings icon. This is just a friendly reminder that you have options!

### What You Can Customize

Inside the settings panel, you can control:

- **Theme**: Switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes to suit your environment.
- **Content Toggles**: Show or hide specific categories of content. For example, if you are an advanced user, you might want to hide "Basic Tutorials" or "Introductory" sections to focus on the technical specs.
- **Navigation**: You can choose to hide Tab Group headers if you prefer a cleaner interface.

## Interactive Elements

This site uses smart components that remember your choices.

### Smart Tabs

We use tabs to organize code examples (e.g., Java vs. Python) or different operating system instructions.

**Reviewer Pro-Tip: Global Pinning**
If you prefer a specific tab (e.g., you always want to see "Python" code), **Double-Click** that tab header.

- **Action**: Double-click the "Python" tab.
- **Result**: The site will "pin" this choice. All other tab groups on the site that have a "Python" option will automatically switch to it, now and in the future.

### Dynamic Toggles

Toggles allow extensive content to be collapsed, keeping the page clean.

- **Standard Expand**: Click the toggle header (or the chevron icon) to expand and read the content.
- **Peek Mode**: Some toggles are designed to "peek". You will see a masked preview of the content with a dashed border. This gives you a hint of what's inside without taking up the full space.
  - _Click the expand button (down arrow) to reveal the full content._
- **Labels**: Toggles may have small labels (e.g., "Prerequisite", "Advanced") to help you decide if the content is relevant to you.
