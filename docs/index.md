   Welcome to Custom Views Library - Interactive Documentation & Demo
</div>

## Introduction

CustomViews is a small runtime that lets you register and toggle custom content (assets, snippets, or UI panels) on your site and share visibility state via URLs. It provides a lightweight widget and API to manage toggles, tab groups and insert assets into the page.

It allows you to dynamically toggle content based on configuration and state, providing a flexible way to manage content that can change based on user interactions, preferences, or URL parameters.

### Interactive Demo

**Look for the "Custom Views" widget on the left** to interact with this demo in real-time!

## Demo: Tab Groups Feature

Tab groups allow you to create synchronized, mutually exclusive content sections. All instances of the same tab group stay in sync across the page.

<cv-tabgroup id="fruit" nav="auto">
  <cv-tab id="apple" header="Apple">
  
**Apple Information**

Apples are crisp, sweet fruits that come in many varieties. They are rich in fiber and vitamin C.

<box type="success" icon=":apple:">
    An apple a day keeps the doctor away!
</box>

  </cv-tab>
  <cv-tab id="orange" header="Orange">
  
**Orange Information**

Oranges are citrus fruits known for their high vitamin C content and refreshing juice.

  </cv-tab>
  <cv-tab id="pear" header="Pear">
  
**Pear Information**

Pears are sweet, bell-shaped fruits with a soft texture when ripe. They're high in fiber and antioxidants.

  </cv-tab>
</cv-tabgroup>

<cv-tabgroup id="fruit" nav="auto">
  <cv-tab id="apple" header="Apple">
  
I love Apples!

  </cv-tab>
  <cv-tab id="orange" header="Orange">
  
I love Oranges!

  </cv-tab>

</cv-tabgroup>


**‚ú® Try it**: Click any tab above and watch both groups update simultaneously! You can also use the widget to control all tab groups at once.

## Why Use Custom Views?

The concept behind Custom Views is very simple ‚Äî showing or hiding elements based on state can be done with just plain JavaScript manipulating the DOM. However, this library provides several benefits that make it more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

Currently work in progress.
