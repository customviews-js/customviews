## Terminology

- **Custom View**: A configurable set of content and behaviors defined for a site or page.
- **Author**: The person who creates the site and defines what is possible—sets up all available views, toggles, and placeholders.
- **Adopter**: The person who provides a set of presets to create an adaptation—chooses which options are allowed and sets defaults for a specific use case or audience.
- **Viewer**: The person viewing the page in the browser—selects their preferred options within the allowed space, with the ability to share their chosen state via URL.

### Use Case & Semantics

In short:
- The **Author** defines what is possible.
- The **Adopter** defines what is allowed and sets defaults.
- The **Viewer** picks what they want within the allowed space, with a shareable state (e.g., via URL).

This separation allows for flexible site creation, adaptation for different audiences, and personalized viewing experiences, all while maintaining clear boundaries between what is possible, allowed, and chosen.
