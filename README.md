# Custom Views

v0.1.0 

Just does hello world.

Custom Views is meant to be a lightweight, standalone JavaScript library for dynamic content filtering and contextual rendering in static sites. It is meant to allow authors to tag content blocks with “views” (e.g., Windows, Linux) or some other way to do so, and provides interactive controls for readers to toggle between them. 

Key target features include:
- **View-based filtering:** Show/hide content based on selected views or roles.
- **Author-friendly syntax:** Use HTML attributes like `<div view="linux">`.
- **Persistent selections:** Encode selected views in URL hashes or local storage.
- **Composable logic:** Support multiple views per element with AND/OR logic.
- **URL sync & shareability:** Share links that preserve view state.
- **Lightweight & framework-agnostic:** No dependencies, easy to integrate.

This library is intended for integration with MarkBind but hopefully can also be used as a standalone widget in any static site.
