## Custom Views

[npm package link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@customviews-js/customviews)

_Custom Views_ allows developers and designers to define reusable content views that can be toggled, personalized, or adapted dynamically for different users and contexts. It is framework-agnostic, meaning it works with plain HTML, JavaScript, or alongside modern frameworks without imposing additional dependencies.

With Custom Views, you can:

- Show or hide sections of a page based on user preferences.
- Persist user-selected content variants (e.g., "CLI view" vs "GUI view").
- Enhance accessibility and provide tailored experiences without bloating your site.
- Select specific parts of your site to share with users in a "Focused" view!

Whether you are building a static site, a dashboard, or a documentation portal, Custom Views gives you the tools to make your content interactive and adaptable while keeping things lightweight and simple.
