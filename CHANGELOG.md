# Changelog

## Next Ver - 2025-09-03

To-do: Implement:
* Add logic for handling static elements vs dynamic elements (toggle / placeholder)
* Persistence across pages

Ideas:
* ALL ASSETS WILL LIVE TOGETHER (MASTER ASSET)
  * Can support multiple JSON files -> Can simply add more JSON if needed.


Custom views is supposed to be a web package library, so it should give a good way to init by giving url to the Assets JSON, some mapping to profiles etc.
