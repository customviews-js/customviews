* Persistence across pages
* Extendible to include multiple JSONs of assets as needed.

Ideas:
  * Aggregate the assets into a singular assets json file that will point to all 
  dynamically loaded content, with unique keys.
  * Can support multiple JSON files -> Can simply add more JSON if needed. (Will need to check )

* Added logic for handling static elements vs dynamic elements (toggle / placeholder)
* Added master asset JSON where all assets live together (MASTER ASSET)
  * Custom views is supposed to be a web package library, so it should give a good way to init by giving url to the Assets JSON, some mapping to profiles etc.

- Change project to TypeScript.
- Add models for config, assets.
